Cellular Automata Simulation SYstem
===================================

This is a project written to simplify the creation of new cellurar automata systems by providing a framework to implement and display running simultaions.


** Modules **
* cassy : parent artifact used to manage dependency versions
* cassy-api : jar artifact containing the common interfaces used in cellular automota
* cassy-engine : jar artifact used to perform simulations
* cassy-models : jar artifact defining several cellular automata
* cassy-cli: jar artifact providing command line interface to simulations
* cassy-swing : jar artifact providing a swing based GUI
